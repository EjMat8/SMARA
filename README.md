## üì° API Endpoints

- `GET /api/apps/search`: Search for apps by keyword or category
- `POST /api/apps/insights`: Send app info and fetches AI insights about app
- `POST /api/apps/datasafety`: Send array of app IDs and retrieve data safety info of apps

### Note on how I fetch these apps and their details:

- I fetch the apps and the permissions (fetching apps, full details of app, and permissions are separate requests) in one request so may take a while if the limiter is set to a higher number. I did some throttling too to avoid any API-Rate limit requests. (I know I will work on optimizing it more)
- After apps have been fetched, I fetch the data safety of each app in the background.

## Notes

Still need to fix some error handling. But overall MVP is done.
